This is an incomplete guide to the Markdown language, only including the elements I feel are most important. For a slightly more detailed introduction check out <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>.

Working with paragraphs is easy. Just write, and add an empty line between paragraphs. Paragraphs not separated by an empty line will be considered part of the same paragraph, allowing for hard-wrapped paragraphs.

To have a br tag, end a paragraph with two spaces and write on the next line  
Like so.

# Example h1 tag
## Example h2 tag

### Adding Emphasis
Single asterisks will be *italicized*.

Double asterisks will be **bold**.

### Web Links
