This was an assignment for our Graphic Design II class. Working in a group of two we had to create an infographic for a topic of our choosing. This group decided on Apple's timeline of their products. This was a great way to refresh our knowledge on Illustrator and help us get better. It was enjoyable to create icons and see the whole project come together.  We were able to see how well we worked in teams as well. This project was created and designed by Demitri Bannoura and Jasmine Phat.
