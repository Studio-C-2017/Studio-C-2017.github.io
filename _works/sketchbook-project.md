This is a project that focused us on the usage of a sketchbook. Students had to develop a theme and do research in order to create a final piece. The theme Solange chose was touch. Solange chose touch because of the different directions she could go with. She went with intimacy and lack of it, as represented with the colors. She used Sketchbook Pro for this painting; this project was created and designed by Solange Nhan.
