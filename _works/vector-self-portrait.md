Our first major project in Graphic Design was to create a self-portrait
using some of the techniques we learned in Adobe Illustrator, such as
the Pen Tool, Eyedropper, and Paint Bucket Tool. This self-portrait
designed by Emerald was submitted to the ACA World Championship and she
won and competed in the competition in Dallas, TX.
