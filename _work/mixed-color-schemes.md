A digital painting created from a reference photo. Rather than using the standard colors of the photo, the piece is broken up into different color schemes, such as monochromatic, complementary, and analogous. This project helped the students learn more about color theory, which colors worked well together and which didn't. This project was created and designed by Cynthia Kar.
