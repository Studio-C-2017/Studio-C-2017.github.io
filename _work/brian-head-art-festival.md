This poster was created for the 2015 Brian Head Arts Festival. Students researched the iconic Brian Head landmarks and the festival itself to see what it offered. We had to create something that really embodied the spirit of Brian Head, the national park in Utah. This art won first place, this poster was created and designed by Keena Venegas.
