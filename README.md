# Studio-C

## SUMMARY
This is the Studio C Class of 2017 website. It contains an about page, a contact page, examples of previous work for potential clients to look at, and short bios for every member of Studio C.

## INSTALL
Currently the website is HTML/CSS/JS, so this code can be run locally on any web browser. PHP and a SQL database may be added in later, requiring a PHP interpreter, copy of mySQL, and a copy of the database, preferably with the Apache server.
