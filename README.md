# Studio C 2017 Website
This is the Studio C Class of 2017 website. It contains an about page, a contact page, examples of previous work for potential clients to look at, and short bios for every member of Studio C.

## Installation
If you have git installed on your computer, clone the repository into any directory will suffice. Assuming you are using a UNIX-based operating system with a BASH or similar shell (i.e. macOS, Linux, or BSD, although if you're using BSD you probably know what you're doing), run `$ git clone github.com/studio-c-2017/studio-c-2017.github.io.git` into your terminal. Otherwise, download the zip file.

This repository does not hold the final site. It holds files that use Jekyll to render the final site that will be hosted and sent to any web browsers. This is not a problem on GitHub as GitHub Pages are automatically rendered by Jekyll.

If working on the site locally or if the site is moved somewhere other than GitHub Pages, follow these instructions. After downloading the repository, download Ruby. Instructions for how to do this vary based on your operating system. After that, install the Jekyll gem by running `$ gem install jekyll bundler`. Change your working directory into the directory you cloned this repository into. Run `$ jekyll serve` and the final site will be available at localhost:4000.

Alternatively, you can run `$ jekyll build` and have the finished site rendered into the `_site` directory in the studio-c-2017.github.io directory. As this website is HTML/CSS/JS, this website can be run locally in any web browser or hosted on any server.

For more information about Jekyll go to check out the program's documentation at <https://jekyllrb.com/>.
