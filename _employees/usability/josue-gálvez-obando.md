Hi, my name is Josue GÃ¡lvez-Obando. I'm a Hispanic-American who was born in Los Angeles, California. I'm currently 17 years old and attending Southwest Career and Technical Academy studying Graphic Desgin and Web Design Development. I am experienced in a few Adobe programs such as Ilustrator, Photoshop, and Flash, but have yet to be certified for any of them. I enjoy playing video games, sleeping, eating ,and hanging with friends.
