My interest in programming and computer science started in the 7th grade. At first, I was simply intrigued by the idea of being able to speak to the computer through a unique language and the level of problem-solving skills programming required; each program was like its own complex puzzle. Over time, I realized that programming can be more than just a hobby, and I constantly search for ways I can help the community with my passion. Accessibility is what I deem to be one of the most important components of creating a good website. I enjoy creating websites that are not only practical but encourage a pleasant user experience.
