Hello there! My name is Anjelika Carson. I may be a future pre-medical student at UNLV, but, at the moment, I’m stuck on the path of becoming a web developer and designer. Possibly, a programmer. I’m certified in Adoble Illustrator CS6, Adobe Photoshop CS6, and Adobe Flash CS6. There’s not a lot I have to say about myself, but if you ever catch me outside of school you’ll most likely find me either binging a show on Netflix and Amazon Prime or, unfortunately, playing League of Legends.
