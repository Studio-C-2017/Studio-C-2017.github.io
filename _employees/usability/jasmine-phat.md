Hi there~! I'm Jasmine. As a web designer, I dabble in making things unique. My passion for creativity and adventure flourish through graphic design and writing; simply, I view the world through a rose-colored glass. Alongside coding, I have a penchant for exploring the unknown and challenging myself. When I'm not creating websites or graphics, I'm cosplaying, flipping butterfly knives, listening to records, or drinking a Slurpee.
