My name is Crystal Menjivar and I am a Senior, Web Design student, at Southwest Career and Technical Academy.  I am Certified in Adobe Photoshop and Flash. I believe that I am responsible, kind, and caring. Out of school, I enjoy Dancing tap and jazz. I've been dancing for almost 12 years now. I enjoy to be outdoors and do stuff such as camping, hiking, and star gazing. I hope to improve my skills in Web Design and in general.
