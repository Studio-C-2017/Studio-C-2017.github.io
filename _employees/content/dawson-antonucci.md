Hey, I'm Dawson Antonucci, and I am a senior in the Web Design program. I was born in Virginia Beach, Virginia on April 22, 1999. In 2009, my family and I moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. I have experience in Adobe Photoshop (ACA certified), Illustrator (ACA certified), and Flash (ACA certified). Along with this experience, I am skilled at HTML and CSS coding.

My hobbies include both playing and watching sports including baseball, basketball, and football. The Dodgers, Raiders, Clippers, and Illinois basketball and football are my favorite sport teams. I also love to watch movies such as The Dark Knight, Inception, and No Country For Old Men.
