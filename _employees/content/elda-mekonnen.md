Hi my name is Elda, as the years went by from freshman year to senior year I have accomplished a lot of things I am very proud about. I have a job at IN-N-OUT and I have a certificate for Flash and Photoshop, something that I thought was impossible to do at one point now is my reality. I like sleeping, hanging out with friends, and eating. I wish to improve my web design skills as I go through more years to come and be able to leave a mark on this world.
