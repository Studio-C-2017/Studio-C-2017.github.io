Hello there! Iâ€™m Brian and I am the Studio C Content Manager. Three phrases best describe me: a passionate learner, a renaissance man, and an ambitious guy with big dreams. I may appear quiet and aloof, but I do have a lot of interests. As a passionate learner, I have devoted large amounts of time in studying history, politics, computer science, biology, and literature. I have Adobe Certifications in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Flash, and I have proficiency in various coding languages as well. My accomplishments mostly relate to my academics as I have achieved high SAT, ACT, and AP exam scores. Outside of school, I enjoy delving into video games, anime, manga, YouTube, and Reddit. I will continue to improve myself as a student and individual, striving to help make Studio C reach new heights in designing websites for clients.
