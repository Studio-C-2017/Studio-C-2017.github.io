Hello readers! My name is Rachel Tsu and I am a graphic designer. Throughout my last four years, I've worked really hard on my art skills which have led me to earn my Adobe certifications for Flash and Photoshop as well as my certificate of skill attainment in graphic design. Some of my accomplishments consist of designing logos for companies such as LVGEA, obtaining second place in the Brian Head Arts Festival, and creating art for a variety of different competitions. I'm ready to do even better and work even harder this year and in years to come. Thanks for checking me out!
