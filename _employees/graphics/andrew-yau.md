Hey, I'm Andrew Yau, a senior in SWCTA's web design program. During my time at this school I've been able to experience many things. I've done presentations for clients, re-designed websites, and taught elementary school kids how to code. Through the years I've also been able to get my Adobe flash and photoshop certification. Aside from graphics and web I'm pretty well rounded student, taking honors classes and keeping my GPA up. My hobbies outside of school include drawing and listening to music. I hope that being in the graphic program will further improve my skills, and in return I hope that my experience in art will help my company.
