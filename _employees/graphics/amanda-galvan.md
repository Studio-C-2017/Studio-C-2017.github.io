Hello all! My name is Amanda Galvan and I'm the manager of the Graphics department, but I'm also known as the girl who stays up every other night designing and coding websites. I'm a future Graphic Design major at UNLV, and can be found constantly entering contests and drawing. I'm certified in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Flash CS6, and was recently recognized by Adobe when I placed 8th out of 33 competitors from around the world in the 2016 ACA World Championship. I do digital art and commissions as work aside from designing for clients, and love producing fan-made charms, stickers, and merch for shows I enjoy! I'm hard working and refuse to create anything less than my best work, so I will dedicate all I can to Studio C!
