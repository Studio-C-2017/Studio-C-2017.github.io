Hey there! My name is Solange Nhan and I'm a designer in the Graphics Department in Studio C. Over the course of three years, I have attained knowledge in various programs and have received Adobe Certifications in Illustrator, Photoshop, and Flash. I also have knowledge in coding as I have earned 3rd Place in Web Design at the SkillsUSA Nevada State Conference last year with my partner, Danielle Johnson. When I'm not stressing out over a multitude of AP classes, I can be seen drawing on my tablet or spending my time on YouTube.
