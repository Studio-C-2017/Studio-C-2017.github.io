Hey there! I'm Demitri Bannoura and I'm a head manager at Studio C! For as long as I can remember, it has been my goal to help others as well as to become a great leader through gaining new knowledge and experience. I have been a part of Student Council since the first grade where I have held many positions such as class representative, secretary, and vice president. I currently serve as the senior class president at Southwest CTA. My accomplishments include receiving an award for community service at the SkillsUSA state competition in 2015 and being recognized for my heard work and dedication to my grades. I am constantly serving my school and community as a student ambassador as well as through the National Honor Society, an organization I have been a part of since my junior year. Outside of school, I enjoy keeping up with the constantly-advancing tech industry. I very much enjoy designing graphics and learning how to code. I also love playing with my two dogs everyday when I get home, and I like hanging out with friends whenever I have spare time. I'm so excited to be a part of the amazing and talented team at Studio C! I've gotten to know all of them throughout the past three years and I can't wait to see the amazing work that we can do for you!
