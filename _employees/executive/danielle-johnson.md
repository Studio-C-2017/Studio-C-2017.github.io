Hi! My name is Danielle and I'm thrilled to be one of Studio C's head managers! I have lots of previous leadership experience, including as the 2015 Hour of Code Head Manager, as SkillsUSA's secretary, and also as the lead volunteer at Furgotten Friends Dog Rescue. If I look familiar, it's probably because you've seen me at pet adoptions on Saturdays where I've been volunteering for close to four years now. I absolutely love volunteering and all things dog in general and have two of my own super awesome dogs at home. I've played soccer since I was four years old and am one of the captains of Sierra Vista's varsity team. Other than that, I love pigs, being artsy, smiley faces, and the color yellow. I'm very excited to see where we can take Studio C this year so don't be afraid to contact us so we can start making great things happen!
