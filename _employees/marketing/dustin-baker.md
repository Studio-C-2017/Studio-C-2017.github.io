Hello, my name is Dustin Baker, and I am a senior in the Web Design program. I have studied marketing in Southwest CTA for over two years. I currently am certified in the following fields: ACA Photoshop Certified and ACA Flash Certified. My favorite hobbies include playing video games and coding. My greatest fear is is not being able to help others in need.
