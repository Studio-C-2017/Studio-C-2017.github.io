My name is John Laurence Viceo Biraogo, and I am in Web Design in the Marketing Department in Studio C. I've been in SouthWest Career and Technical Academy for four years. Throughout my years I've made lots of friends and gain a lot of experience. I learned Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Flash, Adobe Premiere Pro, HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Wordpress, and Final Cut Pro X. For my hobbies, I like to watch movies, editing videos, listen to music, watch videos, play video games, play sports, and eat food. I wake everyday to go to this wonderful school, Southwest Career and Technical Academy. I love everyone that goes here and this school is A+++.
