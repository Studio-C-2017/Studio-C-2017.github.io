I am an individual whose true identity is unknown or must be withheld in a legal action, case, or discussion. I am also every corpse or hospital patient whose identity is unknown. I can be found in the United States and Canada, but am rarely found in other English-speaking countries including the United Kingdom, from which I originate in a legal context.
