Working towards a future in event production, I have devoted my endeavors around graphic design, marketing, and advertising. Serving as the Nevada DECA Vice President of Publicity and the Media Marketer at Sabanetics during my high school career, I am discovering the power of communicating inspiring messages. An adventurous individual, I am looking for growth opportunities to build my skill set and meaningfully change the industry.
