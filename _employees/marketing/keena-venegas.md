My name is Keena Venegas, and I am part of the Marketing Department in Studio C. Real estate is my passion; outside of school, I read to increase my knowledge in the field and prepare me for my future. I currently work at a chocolate shop (and yes, I'm obsessed with chocolates). I am literally in love with penguins.
