My name is Raymond Heinzelman. I have an affinity for trying new things, and everyday I love to pursue my passions of music and learning. I am certified in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, and am fluent in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and am currently learning Java. I play drum set and trumpet in a band, and I aspire to go to college to become a music educator, and possibly look into a degree in psychology as well. I want to take the Studio C coding department to the next level, and bring a new set of skills to the table.
