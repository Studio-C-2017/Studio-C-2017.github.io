Hello, my name is Kenneth Weeks and I am a programmer in the Studio C code department. For the past four years I have learned languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, Wordpress, and Ruby. My learning did not stop at just code, and I have been certified in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Flash. With these skills in both graphic design and web design I was able to be recognized twice for in-state competitions in SkillUSA T-shirt design, and once for a national competition in Web Design, where a partner and I won third nationally. Outside of the classroom I am a piano player, die hard Run The Jewels fan, and a avid collector and design of hats.
