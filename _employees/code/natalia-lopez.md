Hi everyone! My name is Natalia Lopez. I am currently a senior in the Web Design and Development program. I am part of the Coding department in StudioC. Also, I am certified in Illustrator, Photoshop, and Flash. I am part of the NHS club and I do plenty community service. I was born in Cali, Colombia, where I lived for 11 years. I am currently fluent in both Spanish and English. I love to go on adventures with my friends and hiking is my stress relief. I love to play volleyball and badminton. I hope to continue making remarkable memories and achieve my goals.
