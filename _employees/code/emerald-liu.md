Hi everyone, I am Emerald Liu in the Code Department of Studio C. In the past years, I've learned many programming languages, such as HTML and CSS, that allowed me to receive first place in Web Design at the FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America) State Conference. In addition, I have a passion for graphic design; I am certified in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Flash. I also had the honor of becoming one of the three final nationalists to attend the ACA (Adobe Certified Associate) World Championship in 2015. It was a great experience to attend such a competition. Outside of school, I enjoy playing with animals, watching sports, and hiking.
