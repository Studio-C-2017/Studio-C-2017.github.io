My name is Addison C. Qujijano Sorca. I am a Filipino-American whose parents hail from Pasig City, NCR and Libacao, Aklan. I was born on October 23, 1998 at Sunrise Hospital in Enterprise, Nevada. I have a sister who is two years younger than me and five half-brothers back in Pilipinas. I am interested in politics, animation (especially Disney), computer science (both on the software and hardware side), history, and trivia.

I am ACA certified in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Flash. I am proficient in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, PHP, SQL, and am currently working on learning Java. I can speak some Spanish and Tagalog.
