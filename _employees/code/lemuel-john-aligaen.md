Hello, my name is Lemuel John Borromeo Aligaen, I'm one of the main coders in the coding department for Studio C. Web Design in general has taken up a large part of my life ever since I joined this program area back in 2013, I could even go as far to say that it has made a big impact on my life. Apart from coding, I like to do many other things in my freetime; the number one thing that I do is boxing. Boxing has been a part of my life since my childhood, it has given me such a strong and hardworking mindset. In addition to boxing I also love playing video games and traveling to places around the world. Everything in my life has shaped me to be the person that I am as of right now, and I plan to strive to be the best I can be.
